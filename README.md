# Computer-Graphics-with-Unity3D
Semester project for course CSE/MYY702 - Computer Graphics and Interactive Systems

# Unity Project
This project is based on [Unity3D](https://unity.com/) with a simple scene of a cube.
Inside the cube can spawn randomly objects, such as small cubes or cyllinders with the 'space' button. In the centre of the scene there is a sphere which can been moved
inside the cube and can collide with other objects. The objects also have bounciness in order to be more realistic.
The player is in first-person view with his shape to be a capsule. The scripts of the project were made with the programming language [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
